# citygml-3D-building

This project shows the 3D building dataset which is in citygml format. The dataset is from https://www.mlit.go.jp/plateau/open-data/

So, I used cesium to visualize the 3D data that can show the attributes of the buildings as well such as number of storeys above ground, buidling id, etc.
